# Next.js 15 App Router: Link Navigation Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Next.js 15 app router where links, although rendering correctly, fail to navigate to the intended pages. The issue is specific to the app directory's routing system.

## Bug Description

The provided `MyComponent` utilizes Next.js's `Link` component to create links to the `/` (home) and `/about` pages. While the links render without errors, clicking them does not trigger the expected navigation.  The problem only surfaces when using the new app router; the pages render correctly when using the pages router.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper file organization within the `app` directory and potentially adjusting the `href` values in the `Link` components.  Verify that your routes are correctly structured according to Next.js 15's app directory conventions. The solution might involve correctly handling nested routes or re-evaluating your application's routing logic.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Observe that the links render but do not navigate to the respective pages.

## Solution Implementation
The solution includes double checking that the file structure matches the `href` attributes in the `Link` components. We might also check the layout of the pages.
